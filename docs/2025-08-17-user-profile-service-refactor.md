# UserProfileService Refactor and Completion (2025-08-17)

## Context & Motivation

The UserProfileService in the presentation layer required a full review and refactor to:

- Ensure all user-related actions (CRUD, onboarding, geospatial, swipe/match) are exposed as service methods.
- Guarantee synchronization with the appropriate stores (`onboarding`, `current-user-profile`, `auth-user-profile`, and `nearby-swipeable-profiles`).
- Remove legacy code, ensure naming consistency, and simplify usage for React views.

## Action Plan

1. Review the current implementation of `UserProfileService.ts` and all related stores.
2. Review the repository API in `UserProfileRepositoryImpl.ts` to ensure all methods are covered.
3. Refactor the service to:
   - Expose a method for each repository action.
   - Synchronize the relevant store(s) after each mutation/query.
   - Add and correctly type all swipe/match and geospatial methods.
   - Remove unnecessary use of `useCallback` and legacy/duplicated code.
   - Add a local mapping helper to convert repository results to the correct store types.
4. Test and verify type safety and store synchronization.

## Files Modified

- `src/presentation/services/UserProfileService.ts`
  - Complete rewrite and reorganization.
  - Added/updated all CRUD, onboarding, geospatial, swipe, and match methods.
  - Added mapping helper for `NearbySwipeableProfile`.
  - Ensured all methods are ready for direct use in React views.

## Observations

- The service now fully synchronizes with all relevant stores after each action.
- All swipe/match and geospatial methods are present and type-safe.
- The mapping from repository results to store types is explicit and robust.
- The code is organized by domain (profile, onboarding, geospatial, swipe/match) for clarity and maintainability.
- Legacy and duplicated code was removed, and unnecessary use of `useCallback` was eliminated.

## Next Steps

- Update `devlog.md` with a summary of these changes.
- If needed, update `readme.md` to reflect new usage patterns or architecture.
