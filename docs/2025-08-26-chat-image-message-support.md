# Add Image Message Rendering to Chat View

**Date:** 2025-08-26  
**Status:** completed

## Context

Image message support was not previously present in the chat message screen. All messages were rendered as text regardless of type. The goal was to display image messages in a visually appropriate way for sent and received "image" type messages.

## Action Plan

- Review message entity/type and existing chat screen render logic.
- Use the project's own `Image` UI component for consistent rendering.
- Safely branch rendering in `renderItem` based on message `type`.
- Maintain alignment, styling, and performance patterns established by previous architectural and stability improvements.

## Implementation

- File modified: `app/dashboard/chats/[chatId]/index.tsx`
  - Imported `Image` from `@/components/ui/image`.
  - Updated the `ChatBubble` to support children (for custom content such as images).
  - Changed message rendering logic: If `type === "image"`, show the image in a styled bubble; otherwise, fall back to the usual text bubble.
  - Used the message `content` as the image URI.
- No modifications to the store or service logic were necessary.

## Design Notes

- Image bubbles use appropriate maximum width/height and maintain bubble style/rounded corners.
- The solution is safe, minimal, and follows established memoization and state handling patterns.
- Error/empty images show a clear text fallback.

## Impact

- The app now visually displays "image" type messages in the chat.
- This improves media UX and aligns chat functionality with user expectations.

## Next Steps

- Validate in app UI with sent image messages.
- Add test coverage for image message edge cases if applicable.
