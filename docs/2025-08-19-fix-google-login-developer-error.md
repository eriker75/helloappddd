# 2025-08-19 - Fix Google Login DEVELOPER_ERROR

## Context

A DEVELOPER_ERROR is occurring when attempting to log in with Google in the React Native app:

```
[Error: DEVELOPER_ERROR: Follow troubleshooting instructions at https://react-native-google-signin.github.io/docs/troubleshooting]
Error en el inicio de sesi√≥n con Google
```

This error typically indicates a misconfiguration in the Google API Console, Android app credentials, or the react-native-google-signin package setup.

## Action Plan

1. Review the current Google Sign-In implementation in the codebase.
2. Check Android and Google API Console configuration:
   - Package name in google-services.json
   - SHA-1 certificate in Google Console
   - OAuth client configuration
3. Verify dependencies and react-native-google-signin setup.
4. Propose and apply necessary fixes.
5. Test login and document the result.

## Files to Review/Modify

- app/login.tsx (or wherever Google login is implemented)
- android/app/google-services.json (if present)
- AndroidManifest.xml
- build.gradle files
- Any related configuration or documentation

## Observations

- No prior documentation for Google login setup found in readme.md or devlog.md.
- No previous task file for Google login/authentication.

## Findings

- The file `android/app/google-services.json` is missing. This file is required for Google Sign-In to work on Android.
- Its absence is a likely cause of the `DEVELOPER_ERROR`.
- The environment variable `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is set, but without `google-services.json`, Android cannot complete the authentication flow.

## Next Steps

1. Generate and download the correct `google-services.json` from the Google Cloud Console:
   - Go to the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
   - Select the project used for this app.
   - Navigate to "Credentials" and ensure the correct Android package name and SHA-1 are registered.
   - Download the `google-services.json` file.
2. Place the file in `android/app/google-services.json`.
3. Rebuild the app and test Google login.
4. If the error persists, review AndroidManifest.xml and build.gradle for correct Google Sign-In configuration.
