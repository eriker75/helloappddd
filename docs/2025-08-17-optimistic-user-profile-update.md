# Task: Implement Optimistic Update for User Profile

**Date:** 2025-08-17

## Objective

Implement an optimistic update pattern for the user profile update flow. When the user updates their profile, the UI/store is updated immediately. If the request fails, the store is reverted to its previous state.

## Action Plan

- Analyze the mutation and store APIs.
- Implement a wrapper hook that:
  - Saves the previous profile state.
  - Updates the store optimistically.
  - Calls the mutation.
  - Reverts the store on error.
- Document the approach and update the devlog.

## Files Modified

- `src/presentation/services/UserProfileService.ts`

## Implementation Notes

- Used Zustand's `useAuthUserProfileStore` to get, update, and set the profile.
- Used React Query's mutation object for the update request.
- The hook exposes an `updateMyProfile` method for consumers.
- The store is reverted to the previous state if the mutation fails.

## Observations

- The store and mutation APIs are compatible with optimistic updates.
- No changes to the store or mutation implementation were required.
- This approach ensures a responsive UI and data consistency.
